CSC 436 Final Project: Grad Link

Members: Israel Banez

1.) No changes have were made to my goal. I still seek to develop an app that allows graduates in a
new environment interact with other graduates in that area. My plan is still to implement an
application that incorporates components involving Maps, Messages, Authentication, Notification, and
any necessary underlining features that coincide with them.

2.) The deliverables I was able to complete were:
    -Map
    -Messages
    -User Authentication
    -User Storage
However, the deliverables I was not able to complete were:
    -Contact API
    -Friend Requests
    -Notifications
Overall, the core features I that make up the idea of Grad Link was step up.

Discretion When Running:
This app runs best on strong internet signal. A lot of concurrence is happening and certain
lines of code may complete before others. For example sometimes the code will toast that no
user is logged in repeatedly until a few seconds have passed for the code that signals
a user exists catches up. Which is why I find that having good internet helps. Also, since a lot
of concurrence is happening at once, trying to run/ exercise the application too quickly may
cause it to crash. But overall, the application works as intended and I had fun developing it
regardless of the bumps along the way.

Other Notes:
If location is not working (a toast message will say "Location Error"), make sure you gave it location
permission. And, just as a work around, go to maps and click the icon that zeros in on your location.
Then if you go back to the app or rerun it, it should work fine.

Also, even though route's starting destination is the Login Page, if you leave or rerun the app and you are
back at the Home Page instead of Login Page, that just means a user is currently logged in and you need
to sign them out or let their information load in and continue as such.
